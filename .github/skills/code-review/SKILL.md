description: "Review changes along two axes: Standards (repository coding standards) and Spec (originating requirements). Use for automatic pull request reviews, requested PR or branch reviews, and local reviews since a commit, branch, tag, or merge-base."
---

Two-axis review of a pull request or local Git comparison:

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?

Review both axes independently and report their findings separately.

Follow `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` when present. Use available GitHub tools to read referenced issues and their comments; use the documented CLI workflow when its tools and authentication are available. If issue access is unavailable, state the limitation and continue.

## Process

### 1. Establish the comparison

For a PR review, use the PR's base and head and the supplied PR diff. Fetch missing diff or commit context through available GitHub tools. Record the comparison and files reviewed.

For a local review with Git available, use the fixed point the user supplied (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). Confirm it resolves with `git rev-parse <fixed-point>`, then capture `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` and `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Ask for a reference only when neither a PR comparison nor a local reference is available. Report an invalid reference, unavailable diff, or empty diff before reviewing. State any gaps in the available comparison context.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issues linked from the PR and explicit requirements in its description.
2. Issue references in commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, etc.).
3. A path the user supplied.
4. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.

Distinguish explicit requirements from descriptions of what the implementation does. A change summary alone is not an independent spec. Record the sources used. If no spec is available, report "no spec available" and continue the Standards review. If a referenced spec is inaccessible, state that limitation rather than treating it as absent.

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below: a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Review each axis

Use parallel sub-agents when available; otherwise perform both passes sequentially. Keep their findings separate. For delegation, provide each agent with the comparison context and relevant source contents below.

**Standards pass**:

- Use the supplied diff or local diff command, with available commit context.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full (the sub-agent has no other access to it).
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec pass**:

- Use the same comparison and available commit context.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is unavailable, skip the Spec pass and note this in the final report. When only part of the spec is accessible, review those requirements and state the coverage limitation.

### 5. Aggregate

When the review interface supports inline comments, attach actionable findings to relevant changed lines and label each finding Standards or Spec. Provide a short overview with counts and limitations; avoid duplicating inline comments in the overview.

For a single text response, present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Keep findings separate by axis (see _Why two axes_).

Include total findings per axis and the worst issue within each reviewed axis, if any. Mark an unreviewed axis as skipped, rather than passed or zero findings, and state any unavailable context. Preserve the distinction between documented violations and smell judgements.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
